                <h3>What is a Cryptocurrency <i class="far fa-question-circle"></i></h3>
                <p class="info">A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography (the practice and study of techniques for secure communication), which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
                    They are decentralised, encrypted virtual currencies secured by cryptographic methods. The term decentralized denotes that they donâ€™t have any centralised networks and it is impossible for governments to interfere with it. These currencies are based on blockchain technology, which ensures the integrity of the transaction.
                    A blockchain is a distributed ledger enforced by a large network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are not issued by any central authority rendering them impossible for manipulation.
                    As well as this, all information held on the blockchain is publicity available, meaning all transactions and activity on the network can be seen by anyone helping to re-iterate its decentralized nature.

                    <p class="info">
                        Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual "tokens or coins," which are represented and monitored by their respective blockchain.
                        "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.
                        They are a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large network of computers (nodes).

                    <p class="info">
                        The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable. Today, there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications. 
                        Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch and serve to solve a problem.
                        Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto".
                        As of the 1st of August 2021, there are over 18.8 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around $856.49 billion, with the figure updating frequently.
                        Only 21 million Bitcoins can ever exist, preventing both inflation and manipulation.

                <h3>The Importance of Different Systems:</h3>
                <p class="info">The centralised vs decentralised systems debate is relevant to both individuals, organisations and now cryptocurrencies. It affects almost everyone who uses the web and is at the core of the development and evolution of networks, financial systems, companies, apps, web services, and more. While both these systems can function effectively, some are more stable and secure than others by design. Systems can be very small, interconnecting only a few devices and a handful of users. Or they can be immense and span countries and continents, which is the case for Bitcoin. 
                    Either way, they face the same challenges: fault tolerance, maintenance costs, and scalability. </p>
            </div>


            <div class="CvD-box">
                <h3>Centralised:</h3>
                <p class="info">A centralised network architecture is built around a single server that handles all the major processing. Other computers (workstations) connect to the server and submit their requests to the central server rather than performing them directly. The central owner stores and controls the data, which other users can access by connecting to the central server. 
                    Centralised networks means you the user are at the mercy of the owner, take banking for example. When opening a bank account, the bank can decide whether to accept or reject you based on metrics that may be out of your control, as well as this the bank has total control of your accounts and you leave them responsible to manage your finances and ensure they keep it secure. Moreover your information is being held by them and you and the client have no control over how that information is used, in addition to this you can be locked out of your accounts without warning and they have no obligation to tell you why or give you access back. Government bodies can also force banks to give them all transaction history without your consent or knowledge. There is also a major flaw with systems like this, it is that they can be socially engineered inorder to facilitate crime and fraud which you can be vulnerable to. All of these problems are what cryptocurrencies help eliminate, due to them operating in a decentralised manner.

                <h3>Decentralised:</h3>
                <p class="info"> 
                    In computing terms, a decentralized network architecture distributes workloads among several machines, instead of relying on a single central server. A decentralized network offers a wide range of benefits over the more conventional centralized network, including increased system reliability, scale, and privacy.

                    One of the most important benefits of decentralized network management is the fact that there is no real single point of failure â€” this is because each node within the network functions as an independent system contributing to a pool of computing resources. If one component goes down or is hacked, the rest of the network will not be compromised and will remain operational. Even if a cyberattack did breach a single system, there is no guarantee that it would contain the valuable data the attackers are hoping to find and exploit.
                    
                    Decentralized networks are also much easier to scale, as you can simply add more machines to the network to add more compute power. However the complex and dynamic nature of decentralized architecture makes it extremely difficult to build and manage. However a decentralized network architecture allows for greater privacy, as information is not passing through a single point. 
                    
                    All the problems that centralised networks and systems face are eradicated when you shift over to a decentralised one, this is because there is no one to shut you down or stop you from accessing the system as there is no single owner, instead everyone on the network acts together to ensure the network stays operational.

                    <h3>Proof Of Stake:</h3>
                    <p class="info"> The Proof of Stake concept states that a person can mine or validate block transactions according to how many coins they hold. This means that the more coins owned by a miner, the more mining power they have, meaning the more coins that are staked (loaned) to the network the more power you have to mine more coins and validate new blocks on the blockchain.
                        Proof of Stake was created as an alternative to Proof of Work (POW), which is the original consensus algorithm in Blockchain technology, used to confirm transactions and add new blocks to the chain. 
                        Proof of Stake is seen as less risky in terms of the potential for miners to attack the network, as it structures compensation in a way that makes an attack less advantageous for the miner.
                        Currently, only altcoins use the proof of stake concept. When a transaction is initiated, the transaction data is fitted into a block, and then duplicated across multiple computers or nodes on the network. 
                        The nodes are the administrative body of the blockchain and verify the legitimacy of the transactions in each block.
