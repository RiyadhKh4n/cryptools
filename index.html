                    <h3>What is a Cryptocurrency <i class="far fa-question-circle"></i></h3>
                    <p class="info WiAc">A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by
                        cryptography (the practice and study of techniques for secure communication), which makes it
                        nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
                        They are decentralised, encrypted virtual currencies secured by cryptographic methods. The term
                        decentralized denotes that they don’t have any centralised networks and it is impossible for
                        governments to interfere with it. These currencies are based on blockchain technology, which
                        ensures the integrity of the transaction.
                        A blockchain is a distributed ledger enforced by a large network of computers. A defining
                        feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are not issued by any central authority rendering them
                        impossible for manipulation.
                        As well as this, all information held on the blockchain is publicity available, meaning all
                        transactions and activity on the network can be seen by anyone helping to re-iterate its
                        decentralized nature.

                        <h3>Understanding Cryptocurrencies:</h3>
                        <p class="info">
                            Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for secure payments online which are denominated in
                            terms of virtual "tokens," which are represented by ledger entries internal to the system.
                            "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that
                            safeguard these entries, such as public-private key pairs and hashing functions.
                            They're a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed and monitored across
                            a large network of computers. Cryptocurrencies face criticism for a number of reasons,
                            including their use for illegal activities, exchange rate volatility, and vulnerabilities of
                            the infrastructure underlying them.
                            However, they also have been praised for their portability, divisibility, inflation
                            resistance, and transparency.
                            Cryptocurrencies hold the promise of making it easier to transfer funds directly between two
                            parties, without the need for a trusted third party like a bank or credit card company.
                            These transfers are instead secured by the use of public keys and private keys and different
                            forms of incentive systems, like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake, which you will learn about
                            later on.

                        <p class="info">
                            The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular
                            and most valuable. Today, there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various
                            functions and specifications.
                            Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were
                            built from scratch and serve to solve a problem.
                            Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the pseudonym "Satoshi
                            Nakamoto".
                            As of the 1st of August 2021, there are over 18.8 million bitcoins in circulation with a
                            total market cap of around $856.49 billion, with the figure updating frequently.
                            Only 21 million Bitcoins can ever exist, preventing both inflation and manipulation.
                            So, what is the point of Bitcoin? As more and more cryptocurrencies come onto the open
                            market, Bitcoins technology gets older and slower meaning it is no longer the best way to
                            transfer money to each other.
                            This is where Bitcoin use was to become a store of value (any commodity or asset that would
                            normally retain purchasing power into the future), just like how gold used to be the
                            commodity we based fiat currency off.

                    <h3>The Birth of Ethereum <i class="fab fa-ethereum"></i></h3>
                    <p class="info">
                        Ethereum is a digital platform based on blockchain technology and was designed and created by
                        Vitalik Buterin on the 30th of July 2015.
                        It was born with the aim of becoming an open source platform, based on blockchain technology, so
                        as to allow any developer with capacity to create and execute decentralized applications.
                        It is designed so that applications can be executed exactly as they were programmed, without at
                        any time stop working, suffer from some censorship, interference from a third party or fraud
                        attempts.
                        Just as bitcoin or BTC is used as a payment method between peers, Ether or ETH also performs the
                        same function. Another similarity with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is that it is not
                        controlled by any government or any regulator. It’s main feature is Smart Contracts.
                        A Smart Contract is an application created with open source acting as the only intermediary
                        between two or more people when making an exchange of anything that has value, such as money,
                        property, physical or intellectual property, etc.
                        Ethereum is a network, which after Bitcoin, is the most relevant project in the world of
                        cryptocurrencies, since it was born and is for the utility provided by Smart Contracts. The
                        network's users can create, publish, monetize, and use applications on the platform, and use its
                        Ether cryptocurrency as payment.

                <h3>The Importance of Different Systems:</h3>
                <p class="info">
                    The centralized vs decentralized systems debate is relevant to both individuals, organisations and
                    now cryptocurrencies.
                    It affects almost everyone who uses the web and is at the core of the development and evolution of
                    networks, financial systems, companies, apps, web services, and more.
                    While both these systems can function effectively, some are more stable and secure than others by
                    design. Either way, they face the same challenges: fault tolerance, maintenance costs, and
                    scalability.
                    All cryptocurrencies operate in a decentralized environment meaning they gain the advantage of
                    faster and more secure networks.
                </p>
            </div>


            <div class="CvD-box">
                <h3>Centralised:</h3>
                <p class="info">A centralised network architecture is built around a single server that handles all the
                    major processing. Other computers (workstations) connect to the server and submit their requests to
                    the central server rather than performing them directly. The central owner stores and controls the
                    data, which other users can access by connecting to the central server.
                    Centralised networks means you the user are at the mercy of the owner, take banking for example.
                    When opening a bank account, the bank can decide whether to accept or reject you based on metrics
                    that may be out of your control, as well as this the bank has total control of your accounts and you
                    leave them responsible to manage your finances and ensure they keep it secure. Moreover your
                    information is being held by them and you and the client have no control over how that information
                    is used, in addition to this you can be locked out of your accounts without warning and they have no
                    obligation to tell you why or give you access back. Government bodies can also force banks to give
                    them all transaction history without your consent or knowledge. There is also a major flaw with
                    systems like this, it is that they can be socially engineered inorder to facilitate crime and fraud
                    which you can be vulnerable to. All of these problems are what cryptocurrencies help eliminate, due
                    to them operating in a decentralised manner.
                </p>


            </div>

            <div class="CvD-box">
                <h3>Decentralised:</h3>
                <p class="info">
                    In computing terms, a decentralized network architecture distributes workloads among several
                    machines, instead of relying on a single central server. A decentralized network offers a wide range
                    of benefits over the more conventional centralized network, including increased system reliability,
                    scale, and privacy.

                    One of the most important benefits of decentralized network management is the fact that there is no
                    real single point of failure — this is because each node within the network functions as an
                    independent system contributing to a pool of computing resources. If one component goes down or is
                    hacked, the rest of the network will not be compromised and will remain operational. Even if a
                    cyberattack did breach a single system, there is no guarantee that it would contain the valuable
                    data the attackers are hoping to find and exploit.

                    Decentralized networks are also much easier to scale, as you can simply add more machines to the
                    network to add more compute power. However the complex and dynamic nature of decentralized
                    architecture makes it extremely difficult to build and manage. However a decentralized network
                    architecture allows for greater privacy, as information is not passing through a single point.

                    All the problems that centralised networks and systems face are eradicated when you shift over to a
                    decentralised one, this is because there is no one to shut you down or stop you from accessing the
                    system as there is no single owner, instead everyone on the network acts together to ensure the
                    network stays operational.

                        <h3>Proof Of Stake:</h3>
                    </div>

                    <p class="info"> The Proof of Stake (PoS) concept states that a person can mine or validate block
                        transactions according to how many coins they hold. This means that the more coins owned by a
                        miner, the more mining power they have, meaning the more coins that are staked (loaned) to the
                        network the more power you have to mine more coins and validate new blocks on the blockchain.
                        Proof of Stake was created as an alternative to Proof of Work (POW), which is the original
                        consensus algorithm in Blockchain technology, used to confirm transactions and add new blocks to
                        the chain.
                        Proof of Stake is seen as less risky in terms of the potential for miners to attack the network,
                        as it structures compensation in a way that makes an attack less advantageous for the miner.
                        Currently, only altcoins use the proof of stake concept. When a transaction is initiated, the
                        transaction data is fitted into a block, and then duplicated across multiple computers or nodes
                        on the network.
                        The nodes are the administrative body of the blockchain and verify the legitimacy of the
                        transactions in each block.

                        <h3>Proof of Work:</h3>
                    </div>

                    <p class="info">Proof of Work (PoW) is the mechanism that allows the decentralised network to come
                        to consensus, or agree on things like account balances and the order of transactions.
                        This prevents users "double spending" their coins and ensures that the chain is incredibly
                        difficult to attack or overwrite. Proof-of-work is the underlying algorithm that sets the
                        difficulty and rules for the work miners do.
                        Mining is the "work" itself. It's the act of adding valid blocks to the chain. This is important
                        because the chain's length helps the network spot the valid chain and understand the chain's
                        current state. The more "work" done, the longer the chain, and the higher the block number, the
                        more certain the network can be of the current state of things.
                        In short Proof of work is a decentralised consensus mechanism that requires members of a network
                        to expend effort solving an arbitrary mathematical puzzle to prevent anybody from gaming the
                        system.
                        The major drawback of PoW is that at scale it requires huge amounts of energy, which only
                        increases as more miners join the network.
