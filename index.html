                <h3>What is a Cryptocurrency <i class="far fa-question-circle"></i></h3>
                <p class="info">A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography (the practice and study of techniques for secure communication), which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
                    They are decentralised, encrypted virtual currency secured by cryptographic methods. The term decentralized denotes that they don’t have any centralized networks and it is merely possible for government bodies to interfere in it. These currencies are based on blockchain technology which ensures the integrity of the transaction. A blockchain is a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority i.e. Governments, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding Cryptocurrencies:</h3>
                    <p class="info">
                        Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual "tokens or coins," which are represented and monitored by their respective blockchain.
                        "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.
                        They are a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers (nodes). 
                        This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.

                    <h3>The Birth of Bitcoin <i class="fab fa-bitcoin"></i></h3>
                    <p class="info">
                        The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable. Today, there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications. 
                        Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch and serve to solve a problem.
                        Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto.
                        As of the 1st of August 2021, there are over 18.8 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around $856.4.9 billion, with the figure updating frequently.
                        Only 21 million Bitcoins can ever exist, preventing both inflation and manipulation.

                <h2>Centralised vs. Decentralised</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="CvD-overview">
                <h3>The Importance of Different Systems</h3>
                <p class="info">The centralized vs decentralized systems debate is relevant to both individuals, organisations and now cryptocurrencies. It affects almost everyone who uses the web and is at the core of the development and evolution of networks, financial systems, companies, apps, web services, and more. While both these systems can function effectively, some are more stable and secure than others by design. Systems can be very small, interconnecting only a few devices and a handful of users. Or they can be immense and span countries and continents, which is the case for Bitcoin. 
                    Either way, they face the same challenges: fault tolerance, maintenance costs, and scalability. </p>
            </div>


            <div class="CvD-box">
                <h3>Centralised</h3>
                <p class="info" >A centralized network architecture is built around a single server that handles all the major processing. 
                    Other computers (workstations) connect to the server and submit their requests to the central server rather than performing them directly. 
                    The central owner stores data, which other users can access, and also user information.
                    Centralised networks means you the user are at the mercy of the owner, Facebook now has more than 2 billion monthly active users. 
                    This makes Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s CEO, the unelected president of the largest country in the world. Another example is Google, the undisputed ruler of web search, which processes more than 5 billion queries per day. Its name has literally become a verb. People trust it to answer their questions about everything. This huge amount of power has turned these companies into gatekeepers of information and we have to trust them to use their power fairly and responsibly. For example, should Zuckerberg decide to turn evil and abuse his power to give fake and misleading content to the users, there’s virtually nothing stopping him. Or should Google decide to manipulate search results to favor its own bottom line to the detriment of its competitors, there’s little others can do.

            <div class="CvD-box">
                <h3>Decentralised</h3>
                <p class="info">In computing terms, a decentralized network architecture distributes workloads among several machines, instead of relying on a single central server. A decentralized network offers a wide range of benefits over the more conventional centralized network, including increased system reliability, scale, and privacy. One of the most important benefits of decentralized network management is the fact that there is no real single point of failure—this is because individual users’ machines are not reliant on a single central server to handle all processes. Meaning if a computer on the network was hacked, the network would stay intact and ensure no data is lost, maintaining integrity. Decentralized networks are also much easier to scale, as you can simply add more machines to the network to add more compute power. In addition to this, a decentralized network architecture allows for greater privacy, as information is not passing through a single point and instead passes through a number of different points. 
                    This makes it much more difficult to track across a network. </p>
