                <h3>What is a Cryptocurrency <i class="far fa-question-circle"></i></h3>
                <p class="info">A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography (the practice and study of techniques for secure communication),
                    which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
                    Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology â€” a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.
                    A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central authority i.e. Governments, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.

                    <h3>Understanding Cryptocurrencies:</h3>
                    <p class="info">
                        Cryptocurrencies are systems that allow for secure payments online which are denominated in terms of virtual "tokens or coins," which are represented and monitored by their respective blockchain.
                        "Crypto" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.
                        They are a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed across a large number of computers (nodes). 
                        This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities.

                    <h3>The Birth of Bitcoin <i class="fab fa-bitcoin"></i></h3>
                    <p class="info">
                        The first blockchain-based cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which still remains the most popular and most valuable. Today, there are thousands of alternate cryptocurrencies with various functions and specifications. 
                        Some of these are clones or forks of Bitcoin, while others are new currencies that were built from scratch and serve to solve a problem.
                        Bitcoin was launched in 2009 by an individual or group known by the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto.
                        As of the 1st of August 2021, there are over 18.8 million bitcoins in circulation with a total market cap of around $856.4.9 billion, with the figure updating frequently.
                        Only 21 million Bitcoins can ever exist, preventing both inflation and manipulation.
