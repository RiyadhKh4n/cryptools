                    <h3>Centralised Exchanges (CEXs):</h3>
                </div>

                <h4 class="how">How Do They Work?</h4>

                <p class="info">
                    With your typical centralized exchange, you deposit your money – either fiat (via bank transfer or
                    credit/debit card) or cryptocurrency. When you deposit crypto, you give up control of it.
                    Not from a usability standpoint, as you can still trade it or withdraw it, but from a technical
                    standpoint: you cannot spend it on the blockchain.
                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    You don’t own the private keys to the funds, which means that when you withdraw, you ask the
                    exchange to sign a transaction on your behalf. When you’re trading,
                    transactions don’t occur on-chain – instead, the exchange allocates balances to users in its own
                    database. The general workflow is incredibly streamlined because the slow speeds of blockchains
                    don’t impede trading, and everything occurs in a single entity’s system.
                    Cryptocurrencies are easier to buy and sell, and you have more tools available to you.
                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    This does come at the cost of independence: you need to trust the exchange with your money. As a
                    result, you expose yourself to some counterparty risk.
                    What if the team runs off with your hard-earned BTC? What if a hacker cripples the system and drains
                    the funds?
                    For many users, this is an acceptable level of risk. They simply stick to reputable exchanges with
                    strong track records and precautions that mitigate data breaches.

                </p>

                <h4 class="benefits"> Benefits of CEXs: </h4>

                <p class="info">
                    Liquidity: Consistently high liquidity means you dont have to worry about the exchange running out
                    of coins and you not being able to buy what you want.

                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    Volume: Centralized exchanges still account for the vast majority of trading volume and is where the
                    majority of users will go to purchase coins.
                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    Speed & Cost: Fast transaction speeds on centralized exchanges contribute to better user experiences
                    as well as enable complex trade types and allow for automated traders (bots) to execute trades.
                    As well as this, because all transactions are done off-chain, users do not have to pay for gas fees
                    when making transactions. Which can save users lots of money, this is because on some chains like
                    $ETH
                    the gas fees can be higher than the actual transaction amount.
                </p>

                <h4 class="drawbacks"> Disadvantages of CEXs: </h4>

                <p class="info">
                    Custody: Entrusting an exchange with your private keys means you don’t fully control your own money,
                    if their servers go down then that means you cannot access or transact your tokens.
                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    Security: Because they hold a large number of assets, centralized exchanges are a prime target for
                    bad actors. The most notorious exchange hacks were aimed at centralized exchanges (e.g., Coincheck,
                    Mt. Gox, BitGrail, NiceHash, and Bitfinex).
                    If they are hacked, your crypto is at risk of being stolen and you can do nothing about it. However
                    with a DEX this is not possible, the only way someone can access your coins is if they have your
                    seed phrase to your wallet which you should never give out to anyone, ever!
                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    Manipulation & Downtime: Several centralized exchanges have been accused of manipulating their
                    opaque nature and conducting insider trading, fake volume, and price manipulation.
                    Not only this, but on days where markets are dumping, CEXs are known to go down meaning you cant
                    send or sell your coins untill they are up and running again which is not ideal if you planned on
                    selling.
                    However historically, on days where markets are crashing DEXs remain fully operational and you are
                    able to buy, send and sell you coins still.
                </p>

                    <h3>Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs):</h3>
                </div>

                <h4 class="how">How Do They Work?</h4>

                <p class="info">
                    DEXs are similar to their centralized counterparts in some ways but significantly different in
                    others.
                    Let’s first note that there are a few different types of decentralized exchanges available to users.
                    The common theme among them is that orders are executed on-chain (with smart contracts) and that
                    users do not sacrifice custody of their funds at any point.
                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    Every order (as well as alteration and cancellation) is written to the blockchain.
                    This is arguably the most transparent approach, as you’re not trusting a third party to relay the
                    orders to you.
                    Unfortunately, it’s also the most impractical. Since you’re asking every node on the network to
                    record the order forever, you end up paying a fee - called a 'gas fee'.
                    You need to wait until a miner adds your message to the blockchain, meaning the experience can be
                    cumbersome, too.
                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) bring buyers and sellers together. Most are permissionless, meaning
                    that anyone can access them and trade without intermediaries.
                    Transactions are carried out without third-party involvement, users maintain full control over their
                    cryptocurrencies throughout the trading process.
                    Volumes cannot be faked, and the technology powering DEX smart contracts is open source and
                    auditable by anyone, making them more reliable.

                </p>

                <h4 class="benefits"> Benefits of DEXs: </h4>

                <p class="info">
                    No KYC (Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering)
                    Compliance is the norm for many exchanges. Individuals must often submit identity documentation and
                    proof of address.
                    This is a privacy concern for some and an accessibility concern for others. What if you don’t have
                    valid documents on hand? What if the information is somehow leaked? Since DEXs are permissionless,
                    no one checks your identity. All you need is a cryptocurrency wallet.

                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    No counterparty risk - The primary appeal of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges is that they
                    don’t hold customers’ funds, meaning you are always in control of your coins.

                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    Unlisted tokens - Tokens that aren’t listed on centralized exchanges can still be traded freely on
                    DEXs, provided there’s supply and demand.
                    This is because CEXs often have to audit and check a token is legit before listing it, and with the
                    rate of tokens that are being listed it is impossible for them to list them all.
                    This is why DEXs are great as they are able to list coins as soon as they come to market meaning you
                    are able to get in early reap the biggest gains.
                </p>

                <h4 class="drawbacks"> Disadvantages of DEXs: </h4>

                <p class="info">
                    Trade Failures - Because the blockchain only reflects transactions after they are mined, there are
                    many times where a limit order is both visible on the order books and pending execution and
                    settlement.

                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    Expensive Cancellations - Cancelled orders must be validated on-chain, adding additional expenses to
                    the process of updating orders.
                    The result is market makers, who incur extreme costs from constantly updating orders, setting higher
                    spreads and worse pricing.
                </p>

                <p class="info">
                    Order Type Limitations - Users cannot create more complex orders that rely on assistance from a
                    third party, such as stop-loss.
                </p>
