                        <p class="info"> 
                            Tokenomics — the topic of understanding the supply and demand characteristics of cryptocurrency.
                             To put it simply, it is the science of the token economy. It covers all aspects involving a coin’s creation, management, and sometimes removal from a network.
                             It can be broken up into several different aspects like, token distribution, price stability, governance and how they are minted.
                             Projects need to be able to distribute coins out to prospective users. 
                             If not, the network can exist but no one will be able to use it! 
                             There are different ways this can be achieved. The networks reward validators,
                             or miners, with newly minted coins; others sell a portion of the token supply to prospective users in an initial coin offering (ICO). 
                             Cryptocurrencies are notorious for their volatility. This is a problem as fluctuations attract speculators who can stop the network from working properly by buying and selling en masse.
                             Projects can combat this by ensuring there are enough coins to match the levels of supply. This helps to create a stable price for the coin, 
                             which encourages people to use the tokens for what they’re designed for. Now that you understand the basics of tokenomics it's now time to delve a little deeper!

                    <p class="info important">
                        The first thing you want to check is how the token is being distributed. 
                        There are two basic ways the majority of coins are generated - they’re either pre-mined or released through a fair launch. 
                        A fair launch is when the crypto is mined, earned, owned and governed by the entire community. 
                        There is no early access or private allocations before making them public. An example of fair launch coins are Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Yearn Finance. 
                        On the other hand, pre - mining is when an allocation of tokens are distributed amongst developers, team members and early investors before going public. 
                        The majority of token nowadays come with pre-mined token, so this doesn't mean it is a bad thing however you must check how many tokens were given out and if there are any wallets that are hoarding a large majority of coins,
                        this is a red flag as at any time they could dump (sell) their coins which would crash the price. 
                        On the contrary, if the project is distributing their token to as many participants as possible, you can assume the project is a legitimate one.
                        
                    </p>

                    <p class="info important">
                        The next factor to look at is supply. Just if this couldn’t get any more confusing there are three different types of supply. 
                        Circulating supply (how many coins are out on the market right now), Total Supply (is the number of tokens that exist at present, excluding any that might have gotten burned) 
                        and Max Supply (the maximum number of tokens that can ever be generated. 
                        For some tokens, there’s no determined max supply - a common feature of meme coins). 
                        If you notice the circulating supply of a particular token has been regularly increased by the project developers over time, you can assume that the value of the token will be going up in the future. 
                        On the other hand, if there’s too many tokens being released at once or too frequently, the value of the token might go down.
                    </p>

                    <p class="info important">
                        
                        Thought we were done there? The Market Capitalisation of a token shows the entire amount of funds that have been invested in the project so far,
                        in short, Market Cap = Price x Circulating Supply. Along with market cap, you can also check the Fully Diluted Market Cap of a project, which is the theoretical market cap if the max supply of the token was already in circulation.
                        Market cap and Fully Diluted Market Cap in crypto are often used to rank the relative popularity and importance to the overall market of particular coins,
                        in much the same way as it is used to rank publicly traded companies. In the same way as when a public company releases huge volumes of new stock, this will likely not lead to higher prices per unit,
                        but will increase inflationary pressure on the coin, thereby causing the value per unit to decrease. Fully diluted market cap is useful in examining the total value of a crypto asset to itself over time.
                        Market Cap is important as it gives you a clear image of the size and potenital scope of a crypto. A micro alt, or a coin with a market cap of less than $50 million are very high risk as holders could dump their holdings very easily.
                        This doesn't mean mirco alts are scams but it does mean they carry alot of risk, however they can grow alot quicker as the less money there is invested the easier it is for the price to move. Being able to balance and weigh all the potenital factors of a coins market cap can allow you to determine a coins future prospects,
                        understanding it all can be quite complex however it is a very good tool when identifying good investment opportunities. 
                    </p>

                    <p class="info important">
                        Finally, the Token Model. Ensuring you understand if a token is inflationary or deflationary is key. 
                        An inflationary token (like fiat money) doesn’t have a max supply and will continue to be produced as time goes on. 
                        A deflationary token model is simply the opposite, where there’s a max supply the token is capped at, like Bitcoin 21 million.
                        Most proof-of-stake tokens like ETH are inflationary so as to reward the validators and delegators in the network. However, like ETH the model can change with the implementation of upgrades to the network like EIP 1559 which made ETH a deflationary coin as ETH is burned after every transaction. 
                        So the more it is used and transacted the more is burnt. 
                        Tokenomics is an incredibly important concept for you to understand when you’re trying to decide which crypto to invest in, since the factors included will definitely affect your investment. 
                        But do keep in mind that you should also seek answers to some other questions while trying to value a crypto.
                        For instance, you should look for details regarding the project’s team and the team members’ backgrounds
                        (look for them on social media), the token’s historical performance, its use cases, and if possible, data gained from technical analysis.
